Purpose
This addon was developed to aid in the marking of targets while in a group or raid.

 

I am not the original author.  I took LuckyCharms2 (https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/luckycharms2) and updated it for WoW Classic.

 

How to use LuckyCharmsClassic.

When the charmbar is shown, you can hold down your left mouse button on the lock image to drage the bar around your screen.

The lock image will allow you to lock the bar in place. To toggle the lock, just hold down your shift key and left click.

The lock image will also allow you to open the configuration window. To do so just right click on the lock image.

The Kill Order frame displays a button labeled KO that will print the kill order to party, raid, and/or raid warning depending on the options you have chosen in the settings. It also displays the current CC that you can mouse over and get detailed info on. You can hide the kill order frame if you wish, however, it is bound to the charmbar so if you hide the charmbar, the kill order frame will automatically hide.

Right click on any charm to define a crowd control assignment to that charm.
Shift + Right click a charm to remove the CC from that charm
Right click the clear charm to clear all CC assignments

If selected, pressing the KO button will print the kill order as well as cc assignments to party, raid, and/or raid warning. This setting is available in the KO options.
